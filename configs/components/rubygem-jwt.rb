# Component release information:
#   https://rubygems.org/gems/jwt
#   https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt/blob/v3.1.2/CHANGELOG.md
# Notes:
#   This seems to only be for the bundled gcloud_inventory module
#   in Bolt, which itself has a dependency of ~> 2.2.1. So probably
#   this isn't even having the effect we want. Should take a look to
#   see if we should just remove this component.
