# Component release information:
#   https://rubygems.org/gems/connection_pool
#   https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool/blob/main/Changes.md
# Notes:
#   2025-09-03: 2.5.0 changes behavior to reap idle connections after 60 seconds by default.
#   We need to test this before upgrading to ensure it doesn't break anything or
#   affect performance. There are no security fixes between 2.4.1 and 2.5.4.
